Add Functionality to Your Page
To make your Visualforce page functional, you either use a standard controller or a custom controller. Deciding which controller to use depends on your project. You can extend the standard controller to add more functionality related to the specific standard object, or you can create a custom controller from scratch and define functionality across multiple objects. Letâ€™s discuss the differences between a standard or customer controller.

Standard Controller
A standard controller exists for every Salesforce standard object. Standard controllers are powerful classes prewritten for you. Once a standard controller has been added to a Visualforce page, that page will have basic record operation functionality such as create, read, update, and delete. You use a standard controller if you need the basic object functionality.
